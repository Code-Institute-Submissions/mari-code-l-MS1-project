# My Web Portfolio
## Milestone Project 1
#### Introduction
Welcome to my first milestone project "My Web Portfolio".
Last 2020, I have decided to enroll in a Full Stack Development course with Code Institute with hopes to change my career from hospitality Industry to a developer.
A career change is a tough decision especially if you are starting from scratch. I've been living in Germany for four years now and I've been struggling which path to take since i moved out from my country
because what I’ve studied in my country wasn't recognized by the German school system. Now here I am starting another path. 
I believe that if you have faith in everything u do, you will be able to succeed!

I have decided to make a Portfolio for my first milestone project because I believe that I will be needing it in the future when starting my career as a developer.

Thank you for viewing my project and I hope u enjoy it.

## UX
This Web Portfolio project targets the users and employers attention on its minimalism yet clear, smooth and modern portfolio design.
It has user-friendly functions and with an over all experience.

Project planning has 5 planes:
* Strategy Plane
* Scope Plane
* Structure Plane
* Skeleton Plane
* Surface Plane

### 1. Strategy
The aim of this project is to give awareness to the user that a work portfolio can be modern in terms of images showing the best feature of yourself being you. 
Curriculum Vitae’s photo can have the best smile that u could ever have to show the employers the best version of you inside and outside of work environment. 
This project will draw attention to the user for the fast employment, keeping the UX simple and user-friendly and leading users to contact the employee directly through its attracting buttons. 
Its a Mobile-first approach designed site. The content is minimal yet it has complex and meaningful Information. It has easy reference to social media in every pages that gives the users complex Information of the employee. 
It has a strong contrasting buttons on landing page which will direct the user to the specific goal of a user.

### 2. Scope
A Minimal Viable Product (MVP) approach which provides users an absolute UX. It matched my current skill-set and focuses on getting in touch directly to the employee. I’ve added a basic animations to enhance the over all experience.

### 3. Structure
The structure of the project is focused on the main contact Information which are the buttons with a nice touch of colour contrast and quality imagery. It provides enough Information which is short and clear. 
Social links are provided as well to get to know more the product or the employee.

### 4. Skeleton
Below is a link to the draft of the wireframes:
#### Wireframes

[About me page](/workspace/MS1-project/images/wireframe/about-me.png)

[Contact page](/workspace/MS1-project/images/wireframe/contact.png)

* Its skeleton is made up with wireframes using Balsamiq. It has 3 pages:
* Homepage - Landing text with word logo, navigation bar, hire me button and social media links.
* About me - It consists of navigation bar as well as social links. Imagery to highlight the content.
* Contact -  Navigation bar and social links are included as well. Contact form and Information for more details. 
* Download  CV button is to direct the users to print or to download the Curriculum Vitae for its convenience.

### 5. Surface
I have decided on a simple yet elegant background image (woman with glasses) which has a complex meaning of intelligence.
Primary colours that I have chosen are #fafafa and #ffc609e5 for its simplicity yet it gives clarity of the content. To highlight to main focus, I used #ff0909e5 and #ffc609e5. To hover the button i used #000000.
For Typography I have chosen 'Oswald', sans-serif for its neutral and understandable look.

## PROJECT BARRIERS AND SOLUTION
* Language barrier when it comes to technical terms which I had to cope up with and let me behind with my lessons and coding. 
My solution is that I tried to code and understand how it functions.
* I didn't have any experience in coding because I was in a Hotel and Tourism Industry which made me difficult to understand.
My solution was to keep on coding, trial and error to see how everything functions in Web developer Industry.
* Using gitpod was a struggle. I was trying to figure out how does it work especially when commiting. I didnt understand what does commit means 
because English is not my Mother language. My solution was that I attended webinars which it made me clear to understand the use of Gitpod. 
* 3 background image for every pages which I wasn't knowledgeable that is not possible that made conflicts on my page.
My solution was using 1 background image which is easy to design.
* Text inside the Image. My solution was I asked the Slack community and tried to research that it should be inside the div.
* Hamburger button doesn't show up. I contacted the tutor support to resolve issue which the navbar button should be changed into dark.
* Alignment of the contact form. I have asked the Slack community but then I ended up by solving it myself by changing some elements and style them new.
* Positioning of the social media links which i ended up using bootstrap to fix them at the bottom while the social media links on about me section since 
it has a long content, I made its own element and added the same design which it worked.
* Media queries was hard for me to understand even if I watch tutorials. At the end I tried fixing it myself by trial and error which it made me more understand.
* Wrong divs which disaligned my content. I fixed it by using CSS and HTML validator.
* Im not so familiar on Dev tools yet but still learning on the process.
* Bugs in opening links in other tab. I fixed it by putting "target="_blank"" on every links.
* Images stretched and pixelated in "About me" page. I fixed it by putting the images inside "div" then applied proper size, height, width, styles etc. in CSS.
* Instead of Wireframe url in my read me file, I did screenshots of wireframes, put them in Gitpod images folder to be clearly seen.
* Mistakes on media queries has been corrected by adjusting the sizes.
* Instead of putting the url images, I have wrote down the name of every images producers then put the code snippet beside to be clear.
* Doubled "head" in about me file. I have deleted the doubled one.
