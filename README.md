A Web Portfolio project that will attract users in an instant with its user-friendly functions  and with an over all experience.

## UX
This website project targets the users and employers attention on its minimalism yet clear, smooth and modern portfolio design.
### 1. Strategy
The aim of this project is to give awareness to the user that a work portfolio can be modern in terms of images showing the best feature of yourself being you. Curriculum Vitae’s photo can have the best smile that u could ever have to show the employers the best version of you inside and outside of work environment. This project will draw attention to the user for the fast employment, keeping the UX simple and user-friendly and leading users to contact the employee directly through its attracting buttons. Its a Mobile-first approach designed site. The content is minimal yet it has complex and meaningful Information. It has easy reference to social media in every pages that gives the users complex Information of the employee. It has a strong contrasting buttons on landing page which will direct the user to the specific goal of a user.

### 2. Scope
A Minimal Viable Product (MVP) approach which provides users an absolute UX. It matched my current skill-set and focuses on getting in touch directly to the employee. I’ve added a basic animations to enhance the over all experience.

### 3. Structure
The structure of the project is focused on the main contact Information which are the buttons with a nice touch of colour contrast and quality imagery. It provides enough Information  which is short and clear. Social links are provided as well to get to know more the product or the employee.

### 4. Skeleton
* Its skeleton is made up with wireframes. It has 3 pages:
* Homepage - Landing text with word logo, navigation bar, hire me button and social media links.
* About me - It consists of navigation bar as well as social links. Imagery to highlight the content.
* Contact -  Navigation bar and social links are included as well. Contact form and Information for more details. 
* Download  CV button is to direct the users to print or to download the Curriculum Vitae for its convenience.

### 5. Surface
I have decided on a simple yet elegant background image (woman with glasses) which has a complex meaning of intelligence.
Primary colours that I have chosen are #fafafa and #ffc609e5 for its simplicity yet it gives clarity of the content. To highlight to main focus, I used #ff0909e5 and #ffc609e5. To hover the button i used #000000.
For Typography I have chosen 'Oswald', sans-serif for its neutral and understandable look.

## PROJECT BARRIERS AND SOLUTION
* Language barrier when it comes to technical terms which I had to cope up with and let me behind with my lessons and coding. 
My solution is that I tried to code and understand how it functions.
* I didn't have any experience in coding because I was in a Hotel and Tourism Industry which made me difficult to understand.
My solution was to keep on coding, trial and error to see how everything functions in Web developer Industry.
* Using gitpod was a struggle. I was trying to figure out how does it work especially when commiting. I didnt understand what does commit means 
because English is not my Mother language. My solution was that I attended webinars which it made me clear to understand the use of Gitpod. 
* 3 background image for every pages which I wasn't knowledgeable that is not possible that made conflicts on my page.
My solution was using 1 background image which is easy to design.
* Text inside the Image. My solution was I asked the Slack community and tried to research that it should be inside the div.
* Hamburger button doesn't show up. I contacted the tutor support to resolve issue which the navbar button should be changed into dark.
* Alignment of the contact form. I have asked the Slack community but then I ended up by solving it myself by changing some elements and style them new.
* Positioning of the social media links which i ended up using bootstrap to fix them at the bottom while the social media links on about me section since 
it has a long content, I made its own element and added the same design which it worked.
* Media queries was hard for me to understand even if I watch tutorials. At the end I tried fixing it myself by trial and error which it made me more understand.
* Wrong divs which disaligned my content. I fixed it by using CSS and HTML validator.
* Im not so familiar on Dev tools yet but stii learning on the process.
